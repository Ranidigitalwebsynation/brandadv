                            <p>Analyzing competing products or services can give you an idea of what already exists in your industry. This can help you find ways to improve your idea. It can also help you target weaknesses in your product or service before you spend time and money creating it. Be sure to note your competitor’s prices during this process, which will give you a range of how much customers are currently spending on similar products.</p>
